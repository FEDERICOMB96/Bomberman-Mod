<center>Throw Bombs
<img src="../items/guante.png"></center>
If you have obtained the extra item 'Glove' (You can tell if the hud shows "You can THROW bombs") you can throw bombs.
To do this, plant a bomb and then press ATTACK1 (Default: Left Click). If you play with the camera from above, you can also launch bombs with JUMP (Default: space).
Keep the click/space pressed, aim and release the button to launch the bomb. With the camera from above, you can direct the bomb with the movement keys (W/A/S/D).
You can also do it if an enemy plants a bomb where you are (bombs can be traversed when planted).
NOTE: You cannot drop bombs diagonally, it is only in one direction.

<center>Kick Bombs
<img src="../items/patear_bomba.png"></center>
If you have got the extra item 'Kick' (You can tell if the hud shows "You can KICK bombs") you can kick bombs.
To do this, plant a bomb, get out of it (so that it becomes solid) and immediately go to it.
When you touch it, it will move towards the direction you kicked it until it collides with an obstacle.
